HIGH PRIORITY
#####################################################################################

- Fix Object Location Generation so that object creation involves passing in an argument that is used
    to specify the spawn location, or random if one is not provided

- AppleTree
    - have its genes dictate its height, width, & color
    - also have its genes dictate the nutriousnessness, health effects, and color of its fruit
    - at one end of continuum, fruit is red, nutritious, and not poisonous
    - at other end of continuum, fruit is purple, not nutritious, and poisoness
    - make the genome bimodal, so that fruits in the middle are rare
    - make the genome properties that affect the fruit also affect the shape of the tree
    - make a gene that affects the size of the fruit, and that acts as a multiplier on its health and nutrition values
    - make the tree grow in height over time to its max height

- Water
    - needs to be made ponds of water, not water bottles

- SimpleAI2 
    - Fix PickUp

- RNNAI
    - impliment and test rudimentary feed forward network
    - add prediction learning
    - add reinforcement learning

- UI
    - visualization of rudimentary feed forward network


MEDIUM PRIORITY
#####################################################################################

Animals
    - Convert as many of data structures as possible to arrays and eliminate lists and dicts
    - Convert motor system checks to lists of indexes approach
    - Convert Phenotype traitDict to <string,float> instead of <string,string>, and deal with
        all the consequences where it was being used and recast to int or float

Objects
    - Add a second kind of tree called pine tree
        - have its genes dictate its height, width, & color
        - make the tree grow in height over time to its max height
        - make the tree produce pine cones that have no nutrition and bad health
    - Add deer
        - - sit, stand, lay, sleep, wake, walk, rotate, eat (from ground), drink
    - Add elephants
        - - sit, stand, lay, sleep, wake, walk, rotate, eat (from ground), drink, hitWithTrunk
    - Add wolves
        - sit, stand, lay, sleep, wake, walk, rotate, eat (from ground), drink

Ground
    - Needs to be patches of grass of varying properties
        - height
        - color (green to yellow-green)
        - minimal to no nutrition, correlated with color
        - some way to deal with borders

LOW PRIORITY
#####################################################################################

Collisions
    - Pre-fixing animator and physics, impliment collisions
        - if impact is too large (determined as function of force from collider & mass of collided)
            - object falls over
            - health damage occurs

Wolf
    - bite and claw actions, causing damage

Human
    - hit action, causing damage

AIs
    - move FOVDetection and other AI functionality from Human/Animal to within the AI script 
    - make sure AI scripts have no way to access anything other than the information they are passed

Remove Animator
    - have all animations be a static change from position x to position y
    - call animations directly from script
    - no animation loops

Add Realistic Physics
    - Objects should fall over, run into each other etc.
    - stand up, sit down, lay down, rotate, take steps should all work with this system
    - ideally, pick up would too, hand must grasp an object, if it is too big or too heavy it wont work

QUESTIONS
#####################################################################################
    - what does gameObject.SetActive(true) do?
    - when an object is created, but before its position is changed, where does it appear, if at all? Is that what SetActive does, make it appear
        after its position has been set?
